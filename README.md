# Tray Calendar

I suppose majority of the people has a need in their lives to set up some goals and due dates. Of course there are many applications for this purpose. But hey, where is the fun in using them when you can develop your own program?!

As I use my laptop most of the time (not a smartphone!), I decided to create a small programm for Windows OS for this purpose - Tray Calendar. This should be a nice opportunity to learn a new programming language - Java.

The Calendar has to meet the following requirements:

- show the days of the current month (obviously). The late version should be able to show the previous and the next months (maybe the next year);
- by clicking on the day a new window has to open, this window has to provide elements to set up the time and tasks for this day;
- the days with tasks have to differ from the other days (different colour);
- there has to be an option to add a sound for the task;
- the programm has to be minimized into tray.
